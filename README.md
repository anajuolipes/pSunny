This was made in order to a practice in an online course i'm taking. The point were just making the program sum the numbers i input but i wanted to do a little bit more. I present to you, pSunny!

pSunny is able to storage how many numbers you wish, by asking it and then keeping them inside a list, where the numbers are later summed up.
It was very fun to make, i kinda of bothered Borislav Hadzhiev's system of not letting you input an invalid answer and making you re-entry it. But i hope to take a further look on what he did.

Anyways, i'm glad i managed to finished it and ALSO compiled it in a .exe file (available in the repository) using "auto-py-to-exe".

Thanks y'all so much for paying attention at my project, keep an eye for more :D
